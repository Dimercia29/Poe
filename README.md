## Changes Made Based On Feed Back 

 

Based on feedback received from the previous assignment, several changes have been implemented to the project. The most significant change was fixing the alphabetical ordering of Recipes when they are displayed. Instead of manually sorting the list, the C# method OrderBy on the List class has been utilized to automate the ordering process, which will improve the efficiency of the program and made it more user-friendly. 

Unused code, such as commented code, has been removed to improve the overall readability and clarity of the codebase. Clearer referencing has also been added to make it easier for other developers to understand and work with the project.
